 * @section DESCRIPTION 
 *
 * This program is designed to connect to the servo controller using the COM 
 * port which is usually defined by /dev/ttyACM0. It can then interface with 
 * this port by reading and writing to it. The read write protocol is defined by
 * the POLOLU board which we are using for this program
 *
 * The POLOLU Maestro board allows us to control servo using the POLOLU 
 * protocol. This protocol is more clearly defined in Servo.h.
 *
 * Given the control of the device this program also handles a UDP server which 
 * allows foreign programs to interface with it, and control the POLOLU board 
 * using a network protocol
 *
 * This server is not daemonized, as its mostly run in debug mode.
 *
 * This was developed for Linux and has never been tested in other operating 
 * systems
