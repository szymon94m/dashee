 * Get last known error.

 * the error, the error is reset. So it is always a good idea to periodically
 * pole the board.
 *
 * For performance reason we allow the user to worry about errors at his/hers 
 * preference
 *
 * The response is returned in a two byte represented by char, Only one bit is 
 * always set in these two bytes, The error number is represented by the nth bit
 * set, For example:
 * 
 *     00010000|00000000 - Will suggest Errornumber 3, as the error numbering 
 *     starts from 0
 * 
 * @throws ExceptionServoController If read/write fails
 *
 * @returns The error code
