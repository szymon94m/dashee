/**
 * Virtual Vehicle class.
 *
 * The model class allows to change the model type
 * of the current system, For example the way Plane's
 * are delt is different to Quadcopter or Helicopters.
 *
 * For this you need a middle man, which converts the channel
 * values comming from the client and converts them into a correct model of
 * the plane.
 *
 * For example PITCH UP on on a Multirotor or a Helicopter requires to set
 * the value of two channels. Where as a normal Plane mostly requires a pass 
 * through straight to the controls.
