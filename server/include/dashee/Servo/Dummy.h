/**
 * Servo Dummy class for testing.
 *
 * This class defines the implementation to a binary file
 * which pretends to be a servo, It is useful for testing
 * if you don't have a board.
 *
 * The binary file represents the first two bytes as the error number
 * and consecutive 4 bytes represent a channel, of these four bytes
 * the first represents the channel number, the second Target, the third Speed
 * and the last acceleration. 
 *
 * This program presumes that there are SERVO_DUMMY_CHANNEL's in our file.
 *
 * This class represents one servo/channel at a time, The handle is held 
 * externally usually in the ServoController class, or its 
 * ServoController<CounterPart> version
